# gentoo-arm64
NeddySeagoons ~arm64 Keywording Space

This repo is a work area mainly for adding ~arm64 keywords. 
Master tracks gentoo/gentoo and the branches ore individual works in progress, which should get deleted when they are 
merged upstream.

Don't use this repo. Use gentoo/gentoo instead as its more up to date. Master here is only updated when I need it to be.
If you ignore the warning above, you will want to use a branch, which is likely broken, incomplete or otherwise not working.
Its your gentoo, your way. As always, you get to keep the pieces.
